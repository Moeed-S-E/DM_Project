    "content": "    <h1>Samsung Galaxy S25 vs iPhone 16 Pro Max: Which One Should You Buy?</h1>\n\n    <h2>Design and Feel</h2>\n    <p>\n        The Samsung Galaxy S25 continues its tradition of offering a lighter design that makes handling more pleasant,\n        especially during long-term usage. Conversely, the iPhone 16 Pro Max is slightly heavier but exudes a premium feel\n        that appeals to those who prioritize build sturdiness and a luxury aesthetic. Additionally, the S25 Ultra features\n        a slightly curved edge, which makes it feel more ergonomic in hand. The iPhone, on the other hand, leans towards\n        straight sides, giving it a blockier but stable grip. It's worth considering which design aligns better with your\n        personal preferences.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n        The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra in black titanium continues Samsung’s tradition of offering a lighter mobile device\n        that makes handling more pleasant, especially during long-term use. Housed in its slim titanium frame, you’ll find\n        up to 16 GB of RAM, massive storage options, and a high-capacity 5000 mAh battery for extended life, all while\n        staying under a comfortable size and weight threshold. This unlocked Android phone supports international GSM bands\n        and packs a vivid Dynamic AMOLED display, stereo audio speakers, and advanced face and fingerprint sensors into its\n        sleek design.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n        In contrast, the Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max uses aerospace-grade titanium in its chassis, features improved RAM\n        allocation, and carries a robust battery life boost thanks to intelligent power management. The blockier edges\n        house an upgraded sensor array and LiDAR scanner for superior video capture and camera capabilities. Both flagship\n        devices—Samsung’s Ultra and Apple’s Pro Max—offer top-tier build quality and performance, so your choice may come\n        down to whether you prefer the Galaxy’s ergonomic curves and fast wireless charging or the iPhone’s stable feel,\n        fullscreen display, and integrated Apple ecosystem.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>Display</h2>\n    <p>\n        The S25 boasts Samsung's Dynamic AMOLED technology, ensuring vivid brightness levels and sharp clarity that adapts\n        seamlessly to outdoor environments under strong sunlight. Meanwhile, Apple's iPhone 16 Pro Max uses Super Retina\n        XDR technology, ensuring top-tier resolution and color accuracy, even for HDR content consumption. One important\n        aspect is the reflection under direct sunlight – the S25 Ultra was noted to have slightly more effective\n        anti-reflection performance, making outdoor use simpler. Samsung also integrates refresh rates of up to 120Hz for\n        smoother scrolling, while Apple claims better power optimization for the same refresh rate.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n        The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra’s Dynamic AMOLED 2X display delivers up to 2600 nits of peak brightness, a\n        3200×1440-pixel resolution, and a super-smooth 10–120 Hz variable refresh rate. Meanwhile, the Apple iPhone 16 Pro\n        Max features a Super Retina XDR screen with up to 2000 nits of HDR brightness, a 2796×1290-pixel resolution, and\n        ProMotion adaptive refresh rates.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n        Both versions offer elite display performance, but the Galaxy’s higher brightness and sharper resolution give it a\n        slight advantage in bright environments.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>Performance</h2>\n    <p>\n        The iPhone 16 Pro Max capitalizes on Apple’s A18 Bionic chip for maximum efficiency and top-tier speed across apps\n        and games. The Galaxy S25 uses Samsung’s Exynos KA56 (or Snapdragon variant), offering powerful multitasking and\n        fast calculations. The S25 Ultra leads in GPU-heavy tasks, making it better for gaming, while the iPhone excels in\n        single-core workloads and sustained performance.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Source: <a href=\"https://www.phonearena.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-apple-iphone-16-pro-max_id6680\">PhoneArena</a>\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>Camera</h2>\n    <p>\n        The Galaxy S25 features an ultra-high-resolution periscope lens with up to 10x optical zoom, making it ideal for\n        long-distance photography. Its ultrawide camera also provides excellent stabilization for motion shots. The iPhone\n        16 Pro Max remains the king of video, enhanced by its LiDAR scanner for improved depth and cinematic effects.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n        Both phones use AI-powered enhancements for selfies, with the iPhone offering more natural tones while the Galaxy\n        provides a more vibrant look.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n        Source: <a href=\"https://www.phonearena.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-apple-iphone-16-pro-max_id6680\">PhoneArena</a>\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>Battery and Charging</h2>\n    <p>\n        Samsung supports up to 45W wired charging and reverse wireless charging.
